jpy
===

jpy is a bi-directional Python-Java bridge which you can use to embed Java code in Python programs or the other way round. It has been designed particularly with regard to maximum data transfer speed between the two languages. It comes with a number of outstanding features:

* Fully translates Java class hierarchies to Python
* Transparently handles Java method overloading
* Support of Java multi-threading
* Fast and memory-efficient support of primitive Java array parameters via Python buffers (e.g. numpy arrays)
* Support of Java methods that modify primitive Java array parameters (mutable parameters)
* Java arrays translate into Python sequence objects
* Java API for accessing Python objects (jpy.jar)
